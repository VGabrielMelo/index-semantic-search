# Intelligent Retrieval and Filtering Agent (IRFA)

This project aims to implement an agent based on **Large Language Models (LLMs)** to intelligently retrieve and filter information. The idea emerged from the need to apply concepts of **Machine Learning (ML)** and **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** in a production environment, as part of the final project for the **Machine Learning in Production** course offered by **ITI-UFSCar**.

## Motivation

IRFA was developed to explore how intelligent agents can address real-world problems. The project focuses on implementing a Telegram chatbot that:

1. **Understands user needs** using natural language;
2. **Searches for products on Amazon** via its API;
3. **Filters and ranks products** based on ratings, reviews, and prices;
4. **Offers personalized recommendations** with affiliate links, providing clear insights into the pros and cons of each product.

This approach combines the power of LLMs for text interpretation with external APIs and intelligent filtering techniques, promoting a scalable and efficient model.
